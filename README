Assumptions:
* If the home_size doesn't make sense we trust the source as long as there is valid (non-negative integer in place); i.e. home_size of 2
* sale price is in dollars if no unit is specified
* import is not atomic; do our best to import as much as possible
* import of the same data can be done multiple times; this will update accordingly and not create new listings 

NOTES:
* this is not a pretty website implementation! :)
* It also appears that I missed the mark on the fact DRF was a physical standard library that could be used. So I feel that this implementation misses
the mark of what was expected. It does, however, implement the injest of the data set as requested. 

* I tried to think of where this data would be used and how this would be extended
  * see the 1-N models to allow growth of data points
* The implementation is not the most efficient and would ideally be parsed in chunks to avoid memory size issues
